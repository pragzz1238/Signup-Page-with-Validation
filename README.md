# Signup Page with Validation

This is a simple Signup page built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The page allows users to enter their username and password and provides validation to ensure that users fill in all required fields and enter passwords of the correct length.


## Prerequisites

Before using the Signup page, ensure that you have a web browser installed on your computer.

## Features

### Validation

The Signup page includes the following validations:

1. Username and password fields are required. If the user submits the form without filling in both fields, an appropriate error message is displayed.

2. Password length validation: The password must be at least 8 characters long. If the user enters a password that does not meet this requirement, an error message is displayed.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pragzz1238/Sign-Up-Page.git
   ```
2. Open the index.html file in your web browser.
3. Fill in the Username and Password fields.
4. Click the "Submit" button.
5. If you leave any field empty or enter a password with insufficient length, appropriate error messages will be displayed, and the form will not be submitted.
6. If all fields are correctly filled, the form will be submitted, and you can customize the action to save the user data or perform further operations as needed.
